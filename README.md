index.php is the store display page

indexlogin.php is the login/registration page

indexinvoice.php is the invoice page;
  you have pre-entered amounts carried from the display page
  
  
 Note: 
 I have to add the email input box
 And the login data validation tests are not working; anything can be entered
 Usernames already registered can be registered again too
